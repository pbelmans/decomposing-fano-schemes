This code accompanies the paper ["On decompositions for Fano schemes of intersections of two quadrics"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12517),
by Pieter Belmans, Jishnu Bose, Sarah Frei, Benjamin Gould, Alicia Lamarche, Jack Petok, Cristian Rodriguez Avila, James Hotchkiss, and Saket Shah.

It verifies that a certain conjectural identity in the Grothendieck ring of varieties holds,
after taking the E-polynomial motivic measure. This reduces the identity to an equality of polynomials,
which is checked by using the [Hodge diamond cutter](https://github.com/pbelmans/hodge-diamond-cutter).
